## Problem Statement
- **problem:** Individuals at Chicago are busy; professors, students, workers, advisors etc. and often making a good healthy meal and fast, while finding the different parts for that meal can be tricky. Make it simpler for people to make informed and healthy choices or to get the best food anywhere based on type.

- **problem statement:** Imagine a website application that would give you the grocery list, the cooking instructions, and much more with the click of a button based on your food preferences at that time. Create a website application with a mashup and help students, employees, and professors at Chicago to make that choice easier using local data and prices along with food health data to determine the best meal using the best and healthiest products. Be creative and think about how this best would help time-savvy individuals. Feel free to include whatever features YOU find relevant for the customer.

- **minimum requirements:**
  - You must submit a website application using insights you’ve collected from analyzing at least 2 open datasets.
  - Which datasets can be used (feel free to use others): MyPyramidFood Raw Data provides .xml files with what foods, portion amounts, and condiments that go with certain foods in the US. Combining this with farmer’s markets data, Internet Weather Source, and local data from e.g. stores (Meijer, Pay-Less, Walmart, Target, Aldi, Fresh Thyme etc.)
  - You are required to use JavaScript and GitHub for your submission.
  - Using JavaScript, please adhere to the rules of the W3 School: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp
  - You must provide access to and testing instructions for your submission

- **evaluation criteria:**
  - Customer requirements: keep individuals at Chicago healthy and have them optimize their food, increase local revenue for fruits and vegetables. Be innovative in solving this customer problem. We will apply objective measures to evaluate your application: 1) Accuracy of meal guidelines – we will have a panel of 30 users compare their accuracy of 5 random portion amounts from using the application with actual USDA and FDA guidelines, 2) Number of meal alternatives presented.
  - Technology and code: Create a repository and algorithm that combines different types of local and national data to make it simpler for people to make informed and healthy choices. E.g. a map with directions, prices, and a list of food/meal suggestions. Besides the functionality, we will assess your code. How will we assess the code? 1) Efficiency of code (expert evaluation as well as test with tool for code efficiency) 2) App processing time (real time) 3) Logic of code structure (expert evaluation – how well do they understand the code), 4) The App/mash-up availability is stable and reliable (rating by experts and user panel)User experience and evaluation measures: Besides functionality and technology, user experience also matters. We will assess based on the following criteria: 1) time for completing the task (click stream analysis), 2) Usability rating by our experts and user panel.
